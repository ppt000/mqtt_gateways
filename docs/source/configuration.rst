Configuration
=============

.. note::
	Coming soon!

.. old text
	and some file locations (maps and log files)
	if different from default.
	The configuration file provided uses the sub-directory
	``data`` for all files (which is not the default),
	so that this installation (cloned from the repository) can work as is.
	As a consequence, the log file will also be written in this directory.
