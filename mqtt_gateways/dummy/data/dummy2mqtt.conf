# Note on file paths (or file names):
#   - the default name is 'application_name' + default extension (.log, .map, ... etc);
#   - the default path is the 'application' directory, which 'should' be the location of the launching script;
#   - file paths can be empty in which case the default name and path will be used;
#   - file paths can be directory only (ends with a '/') and are appended with the default name;
#   - file paths can be absolute or relative; absolute start with a '/' and relative are prepended with the default directory;
#   - file 'paths' can be file only (no '/' whatsoever) and are prepended with the default directory;
#   - use forward slashes '/' in any case, even for Windows systems, it should work;
#   - however for Windows systems, use of the drive letter might be an issue and has not been tested.
